File formate:

make sure your column header is in the first row and that the data is in the same colume.

make sure the error that relates to your data is in the colume to the right of the data it represents
and that the header of that colum contains the word error or Error.

It will creat a new cvs file in the place where this file is saved.
the headers name might be different and might add new errors to your exiting data. That will only 
happen if no error is present and it will be assumed to be zero

my_data.csv is an example of what the file after beening caculated looks like. There should be 
antional two colums to your data



Code:
It is horrible code, it is my first time messing around with gui and tkinker and I haven't 
fully grasp the correct way and limitations to it. This means my code does have janky work arounds and a lot of my code is reapeted or re-ran it does work tho. and it doesn't end the run time unless manly closed.

you do need to tkinker, numpy, panda and scipy to work .
